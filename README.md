My art blog named "Nowlha" is a project for my university. For this project, I aimed to create a website with a post page, gallery, contact, and login/registration functionality, linked to a database.
Technologies and Tools Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and database created with SQL bringing a dynamic and visually captivating website for art enthusiasts.
